      "message": "Like a lot of stuff, the documentation never seemed to get fully wrapped up from the discussions...\n\n1. https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/aDDn8JF2rvD74pvk@heinlein/ - This was the latest on the config-clang-tidy tool; the chain was Jayanth\u0027s original proposal and some discussion.\n\n2. https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/76369/9/cpp-style-and-conventions.md - Jayanth never seemed to finish this.\n\n3. There was a lot of discussion in this commit that you probably don\u0027t want to weed through.  https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/76345\n\n4.
