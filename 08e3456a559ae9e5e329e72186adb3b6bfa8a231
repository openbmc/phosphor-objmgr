Let me know if there is an issue there.\n\nOr are you more concerned with reducing the amount of dependencies?\n\n\u003e It will never make dbus calls to other openbmc services and thus the whole \u0027check the api at build time\u0027 is not applicable.\n\nMapper depends on the `xyz.openbmc_project.Association.Definitions` interface, which is defined in PDI. So we have a dependency on that definition.\n\nWe can manually copy-paste the information about the interface into the application or simply use the generated header. Using the generated header is more convenient IMO.\n\nMapper also has a dependency on the `xyz.openbmc_project.Association` interface which it must create. Which is also defined in the PDI.
