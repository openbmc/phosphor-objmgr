      "message": "Thanks Patrick.\nI don\u0027t think filtering on the client side is reasonable for two reasons:\n* For the server, we can obtain the service through dbus path and interfaces. For the client, maybe we want to know which service the current path belongs to (at least IEI uses this command very frequently downstream).\n* If possible, I think it is reasonable to return all services. As for why I didn’t do this, it’s because I didn’t want to break the original logic.\n\nIn any case, it is very unreasonable to use this command to return xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper.",

I agree it\u0027s probably not what is interesting in most cases, but part of this is just due to extra filtering being done by this `mapper_get_service` function.  Probably better to avoid using that?",

Without breaking the original logic, I think it is correct to filter out `xyz.openbmc_project.ObjectMapper`.\n2. Otherwise we could return all service names, but this would require refactoring everywhere `mapper_get_service` is used.\n\nI prefer the first way and would like to hear your suggestions.",
